# Project AI-ML - README

This README provides an overview of the AI-ML project and references the `llm_chroma.py` and `llm_pinecone.py` code files.

## Project Overview

The AI-ML project aims to develop machine learning models for language analysis and understanding. It leverages various techniques and algorithms to process and interpret natural language data.

## Code Files

The following code files are essential for the project:

- `llm_chroma.py`: This file contains the implementation of the LLM Chroma local-vector-knowladge model

- `llm_pinecone.py`: This file includes the implementation of the LLM Pinecone vector-knowladge model

Please refer to these code files for detailed information on their functionalities and usage.

## Installation

To install and set up the AI-ML project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-ML.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AI-ML`

3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run the setup script: `python llm_chroma.py` or `python llm_pinecone.py`

5. You're all set! You can now use the LLM algorithms and explore the project's functionalities.

For detailed instructions on how to use the code files and run the LLM algorithms, please refer to the project's documentation.
